Processing your coding tutor request...

Coding Tutor Response: Hello Sultan Ahmed! It's great to have you here.

As a beginner, "Basic HTML" is an excellent place to start your coding journey – it's the foundation of all web pages!

To help me tailor our session perfectly for you, could you tell me a little more about what you'd like to achieve today with Basic HTML? For example, are you looking to:

*   Understand what HTML is and how it works?
*   Learn about common HTML tags like headings, paragraphs, and links?
*   Try building a very simple web page?
*   Or perhaps you have a specific question in mind?

Let me know what you're hoping to learn or build!
